Evaluation R&D
Ferran van der Have
The cooperation went very well with this group. After the first meeting we had everyone told what they were good at and we could divide the work evenly amongst everyone. After a while we lost one group member, but we all did some extra work to counter balance the fact that we have one less person.

At the hand-in deadline we could not get a working app. All the code seemed fine, on another IDE (Netbeans) we could get the console to print everything just fine. It was Android Studios who was not working well.

We did get some extra time, which was very generous. After getting together we could fix the issue after a long time. 

I am satisfied with the developing process, everyone did what he was supposed to do. 
I learned that even if you divide a lot of the work, it is still fairly difficult to put everything together.

I had never worked with github before, and other members of our group wanted me to use it.
However no one really explained it very well to me how to use it with the coding programs we use. Eventually I had to find things out for myself.
Github didn't work how I wanted it to work, so I just made the best of it.

Altogether I am satisfied with the group and how everyone worked.
