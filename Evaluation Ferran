Evaluation R&D
Ferran van der Have
The cooperation went very well with this group. 
After the first meeting we had everyone told what they were good at and we could divide the work evenly amongst everyone. 
After a while we lost one group member, he was supposed to work on the front end of the app, so it didn't matter much for me, 
as I was doing the back end.

I am satisfied with the developing process, everyone did what he was supposed to do. 
I learned that even if you divide a lot of the work, it is still fairly difficult to put everything together.

I had never worked with github before, and other members of our group wanted me to use it.
However no one really explained it very well to me how to use it with the programs we use. 
Eventually I had to find things out for myself.
Github didn't work how I wanted it to work, so I just made the best of it.
I think it all worked fine the way we worked. Meeting in person is better in my opinion, than reading everything on the internet.

Altogether I am satisfied with the group and how everyone worked.
